## Not Too Dark & Not Too Light

This theme was designed by an autistic developer with ADHD who needed an editor theme that was not too dark, not too bright, and not to vibrant.
Other themes were mentally exhausting to look at all day.  If you're not on the spectrum, it's OK if you don't get that.  The purpose of a color theme is to make doing the work easier. 

### Inspired by Nord

A good deal of inspiration was taken from the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes) color palette and some of the other Nord themes that are out there. Kodiak adds a set of true neutral grays to the palette in place of the blue toned grays to increase the color contrast between foreground and background and leverages the Aurora set of colors from Nord a great deal.
